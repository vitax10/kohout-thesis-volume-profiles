# Generated requirements.txt — consolidated from all .py and .ipynb imports
# Review and pin versions as needed before use. Some packages require system
# libraries (TA-Lib) or have ambiguous PyPI names — see notes below.

# Cloud / Google APIs
google-cloud-storage
google-generative-ai
vertexai
# Note: `vertexai` may be provided by `google-cloud-aiplatform` depending on
# the client version; if imports fail, try installing `google-cloud-aiplatform`.

# Other/Pipeline

# Finance / specialty
sec-api
# Note: the import is `from sec_api import QueryApi` — the PyPI package is
# commonly named `sec-api`. If `pip install sec-api` fails, check the package
# you originally installed.

# TA-Lib (technical-analysis C library)
# This requires the system library libta-lib and a matching Python wheel.
# On many systems you must install the system package (e.g., `apt install
# libta-lib0 libta-lib-dev`) before `pip install TA-Lib` will work.

# Packaging/runtime
setuptools
jupyter_core

# Notes
# - `google.generativeai` was added as `google-generative-ai` above. If your
#   environment uses a different package name, replace accordingly.
# - `vertexai` may be part of `google-cloud-aiplatform` for some releases.
# - Many stdlib modules (json, os, sys, datetime, tempfile, glob, shutil,
#   concurrent.futures, logging, pathlib, itertools, functools, traceback,
#   io) are intentionally omitted from this file.
# - Pin exact versions by running `pip freeze` in your working env and
#   replacing the package names above with `name==x.y.z` entries.
